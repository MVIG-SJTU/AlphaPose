- Feb 2019: [CrowdPose](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/docs/CrowdPose.md) is integrated into AlphaPose Now!
- Dec 2018: [General version](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/PoseFlow) of PoseFlow is released! 3X Faster and support pose tracking results visualization!
- Sep 2018: [**v0.2.0** version](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/tree/pytorch) of AlphaPose is released! It runs at **20 fps** on COCO validation set (4.6 people per image on average) and achieves 71 mAP!

## AlphaPose
[AlphaPose](http://www.mvig.org/research/alphapose.html) is an accurate multi-person pose estimator, which is the **first open-source system that achieves 70+ mAP (75 mAP) on COCO dataset and 80+ mAP (82.1 mAP) on MPII dataset.** 
To match poses that correspond to the same person across frames, we also provide an efficient online pose tracker called Pose Flow. It is the **first open-source online pose tracker that achieves both 60+ mAP (66.5 mAP) and 50+ MOTA (58.3 MOTA) on PoseTrack Challenge dataset.**

AlphaPose supports both Linux and **Windows!**

## Installation
Please check out [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)

## Model Zoo
Please check out [docs/MODEL_ZOO.md](docs/MODEL_ZOO.md)

## Quick Start
- **Inference**: Inference demo
``` bash
./scripts/inference.sh ${CONFIG} ${CHECKPOINT} ${VIDEO_NAME} # ${OUTPUT_DIR}, optional
```

- **Training**: Train from scratch
``` bash
./scripts/train.sh ${CONFIG} ${EXP_ID}
```

- **Validation**: Validate your model on MSCOCO val2017
``` bash
./scripts/validate.sh ${CONFIG} ${CHECKPOINT}
```

Examples:

Demo using `FastPose` model.
``` bash
./scripts/inference.sh configs/coco/resnet/256x192_res50_lr1e-3_1x.yaml pretrained_models/fast_res50_256x192.pth ${VIDEO_NAME}
#or
python scripts/demo_inference.py --cfg configs/coco/resnet/256x192_res50_lr1e-3_1x.yaml --checkpoint pretrained_models/fast_res50_256x192.pth --indir examples/demo/
```

Train `FastPose` on mscoco dataset.
``` bash
./scripts/train.sh ./configs/coco/resnet/256x192_res50_lr1e-3_1x.yaml exp_fastpose
```
